# MongoDB AI Productivity Tracker
This is a MongoDB-based project created to store and analyze student productivity data such as study sessions, sleep records, and test scores.
The goal of this project is to understand how NoSQL databases work and how structured JSON data can be used for basic analytics.

## About This Project
In this project, I used MongoDB to design a flexible data model for tracking:
- Study sessions
- Sleep data
- Test scores
Instead of using tables like MySQL, this project uses collections and documents in JSON format.
This helped me understand:
- Embedded documents
- Arrays in MongoDB
- Basic queries using `find()`
- Filtering nested fields
- Simple data analysis queries

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- MongoDB Compass / mongosh
- JSON Document Structure

## Features
- Store student productivity data
- Track multiple study sessions
- Track sleep records
- Store test scores
- Filter data using conditions
- Query nested fields inside arrays

##  What I Learned
- Difference between SQL and NoSQL
- How MongoDB stores data in documents
- How to query nested fields
- How arrays work inside documents
- Basic filtering using operators like `$gt`

## How to Use
1. Create a database in MongoDB.
2. Import `sample_documents.json`.
3. Run queries from `mongodb_queries.txt`.
4. Practice filtering and modifying data.

## Purpose of This Project

This project was built to strengthen my understanding of MongoDB and NoSQL database design as part of my learning journey in data and AI systems.

## Thank you.❤️
